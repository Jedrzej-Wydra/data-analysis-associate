# Associate Data Analyst Exam by DataCamp

#### author: Jędrzej Wydra

## History
This is probably the smallest project I’ve ever done, yet it’s the one I hold closest to my heart. It was the first exam I took, primarily just to feel like I had truly learned something. It wasn’t about the certification as much as it was about proving to myself that I had gained real, tangible skills. I’m very grateful to DataCamp for providing the platform that made this learning journey possible.
